# ROS2 drivers for EGK Schunk Grippers

This repository serves as a ROS2 and ROS1 (see ros_1 branch) wrapper for controlling EGK Schunk grippers with Ethernet/IP connection. The repo leverages the [EIPScanner](https://github.com/nimbuscontrols/EIPScanner) repository to establish the necessary Ethernet/IP connection with the gripper. 

## Hardware Dependencies

**OS**: Linux Ubuntu \
**Gripper**: EGK-40-EI-M-B

Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 with ROS2 Foxy and Ubuntu 22.04 with ROS2 Humble. \
For the ROS1 implementation see ros_1 branch.\
While the code has been **exclusivelly tested** with the **EGK40** model, support for all other EGK models is not **excluded**.

## Features

- **Gripper State Logging**: Access real-time information about the gripper's state through a dedicated ROS topic.
- **Control Services**: Utilize ROS services to command various gripper actions, such as:
  - `jog_to`: Move the gripper to a specified position.
  - `release`: Release any grasped object.
  - `simple_grip`: Perform a simple gripping action.

Additional information about each service can be found within the `schunk_interface` package.

## Repository Structure

The principal packages are briefly described in the following table:

| Package | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Doc](Doc) | (Contains the necessary documentation to understand how to use the gripper and the .EDS file for Ethernet/IP Assembly communication. All the files can be found on the Schunk website.). |
| [schunk_hardware_interface](schunk_hardware_interface) |  Contains the actual code responsible for establishing the connection with the gripper and providing the necessary services and topics.  |
| [schunk_interfaces](schunk_interfaces) | Contains information about the messages and services used by this repository. |

## Usage

### Prerequisites and Dependencies
ROS2 Humble needs to be installed and configured in your computer.

The only other dependency that the repo requires is [EIPScanner](https://github.com/nimbuscontrols/EIPScanner). Just clone it and build it (it is not necessary to put this repo in your ROS workspace):
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/nimbuscontrols/EIPScanner.git
  mkdir build && cd build
  cmake ..
  cmake --build . --target install
  ```

  Finally, in the same terminal where you are going to launch the gripper node, run:
  ```
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib
  ```
  otherwise place it inside your .bashrc file to avoid doing this step everytime you open a new terminal where you launch the schunk_node.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository into your ROS2 workspace and build it:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/MerlinLaboratory/schunk_ros_interface.git
    colcon build
    ```

### Usage + examples
1. **Launch the Node**: Set the gripper ip in [config](schunk_hardware_interface/config/params.yaml) file and launch the node to start communication with the gripper.
    ```
    ros2 run schunk_hardware_interface schunk_gripper_node
    ```

2. **Access Gripper State**: Subscribe to the gripper state topic to receive updates on the gripper's status.
    ```
    ros2 topic echo TODO
    ```

3. **Control the Gripper**: Call the provided services to command the gripper's actions. For example:

    ```
    ros2 service call /schunk/egk_40/jog_to schunk_interfaces/jog_to "position: 0.0 velocity: 6.0 motion_type: 0"
    ```

    ```
    ros2 service call /schunk/egk_40/simple_grip schunk_interfaces/simple_grip "gripping_force: 50 gripping_direction: 0"
    ```
    <img src="Doc/img/SimpleGrip.gif" width="400" height="600" />

    ```
    ros2 service call /schunk/egk_40/release schunk_interfaces/release "{}"
    ```
    <img src="Doc/img/Release.gif" width="400" height="600" />




# Troubleshooting
### No Data received from gripper/ gripper does not respond to commands
In case the gripper does not communicates with your system, try to allow UDP connection through port 2222 with the following command (pay attenction that this needs to be done everytime the computer is restarted):
```
sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p udp -m udp --sport 2222 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -I INPUT -p udp --dport 2222 -j ACCEPT
```

## Future Development

No further developments are expected.
