Volunteer contributions welcome for these:

*) Enhance documentation.  Note that @brief is ugly and it is being removed.
   We have Javadoc flag enabled in Doxygen which does basically the same thing.
   Need to get rid of numerous Doxygen errors.

*) Revive and/or replace unit tests.

*) Python bindings?

*) Enhance sample applications to at least know their own IP address.

*) I don't see where PIT production limiting is done.
